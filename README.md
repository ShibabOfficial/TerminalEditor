Text or code editor in terminal (better then vim maybe)
## About:
This repo's code was made in c++11 so its pain to code.
You can use included makefile to compile this repo.
### How do run the makefile?
In your terminal paste this command:
```zsh
make
```
And when it compiled then type:
```zsh
./a.out <your_path_to_file_here>
```
#### Code has:
- basic rendering
#### TODO:
- [ ] road map?
- [x] loading files
- [x] basic loop with input
- [ ] a text editor?
